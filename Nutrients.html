                Complex Carbohydrates

            </h3>
            Complex Carbs are made of sugar molecules that are in long,'complex' chains. They contain more nutrients than simple carbohydrates. They provide vitamins,minerals and fiber, all of which are important to carry out vital functions of the human body.Complx

            <h3>
                Simple Carbohydrates
            </h3>
            Simple carbohydrates are broken down quickly and only supply energy for a while.This is caused because of simple carbohydrates consisting of a shorter chain of molecules, so when digested, simple carbohydrates cause a spike in blood glucose levels which
            causes people to feel lethargic and tired.Some examples of simple carbs are soda, white bread, deserts and processes food such as potato chips.

        <h3>
            Fiber
        </h3>
        <p>Fiber is found in most wholegrains, fruits and vegetables. The role of fiber in the body is to aid the digestive system </p>
        <h3>
            Low GI
        </h3>
        <p>The glycaemic Index measures how fast our body obtains energy from carbohydrates. It refers to how quickly The sugar released by the carbohydrates(glucose) is broken down and increases the blood glucose levels. The Glycaemic index is measured or scaled between 0-100.Adolescents should have a moderate amount of low GI food every day because it has many benefits including feeling fuller for longer while having increased concentration levels and helping control weight as you don't feel like snacking since you feel full. Some foods which have a low GI include Carisma potatoes, most fruit and vegetables,Barely, dense wholegrain bread,Basmati rice, milk and yogurt and nuts.</p>
